    worked on looking at dd_serial.cpp, looked up modules that parallelize
    scheme code, read the drug design documentation on macalester's webpage.
    Worked on scheme code: finished these  - 
        generate-tasks 
        functions in "dd_helper.scm" 
        score (does not completely work) 
        functions in "dd_algorithm.scm"

wed 05/05 - 1:30 
    worked on making score give correct output for a know ligand (it works
    now).

thu 05/06 - no work

fri 05/07 - 2:00 
    Started working on the data structures: created "dd_ds.scm" which has
    the needed definitions of queue methos, vector<pair> methods, and pair
    methods (these work). 

sat 05/08 - no work 
sun 05/09 - no work 
mon 05/10 - 3:00
    here I implemented the map function that applies score function to all
    the ligands. there is some issues with it, so I will have to work on it
    more tomorrow. 

tue 05/11 - 2:00
    I finished the Map functionality today, so now the only things left are
    reduce and sort.

wed 05/12 - 1:00
    It was relatively easier to make the reduce function after talking with 
    RAB. I didn't have to make the sort function either which saved a lot of
    time. 

thu 05/13 - 6:30 (finished the sequential scheme code - "dd_serial.scm")
    staring to use paralleization. I tried to make work with the Futures
    and touch module in file "dd_p1.scm". It seems to have worked to be
    able to compile; however, while timing it, it clearly looks like its
    not any faster than "dd_serial.scm"

fri 05/14 - 00:40 
    during class time worked on looking up the number of cores that scheme
    uses for the par-map uses (it's 4). I also looked up more examples of 
    paralleization in scheme using different method.
    Added a split list method to "dd_helper.scm"

sat 05/15 - 6:00
    tried multiple ways to parallelize using par-map (a lot of debugging).
    I got it to work, though again it seems to be overall way slower...So 
    I worked on it some more where I was able to get it to be only 3-5sec
    faster than the serial scheme code. 
    I spent a lot of time timing the code in "time_analysis.scm" when it 
    finally worked. 

sun 05/16 - 3:40
    I worked on making the video/timing/writing the potential reasons for 
    the value. Also worked on writing the final plan document. I created
    a ppt for video and also made some more time tests to get more data
    (on another machine).Also spent some time editing the video to make 
    sure that it's 3 mins long total!

thurs 05/20 - 2:20
    I worked on doing research on what to use for timing. I looked into mit 
    scheme and into other timing documentations such as in Racket. I still 
    dont know how to get it to work. 
    I have also worked on planning how to reduce the scheme code in a new
    document. To make it scheme like.

Friday 05/21 - 7:10
    Made changes to plan document. Created the video. Had some issue with WSL
    that i didnt know how to fix so this took a chuck of time. Also here I was
    able to work on making the scheme just slightly more compressed.
    I spent a lot of time on creating a timing system. For some reason, it was
    very hard to get the documentation to work: there were no examples, so I 
    was having a tough time getitng it to work since there were no examples. 
    Also alot of the tests ran for minutes (some going up taking 10 minutes
    per run). I also tried working in MIT-Scehme instead of guile, so I tested
    around on that too for around an hour.
